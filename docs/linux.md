# Linux

## Shared Directories

Linux distributions typically follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines where different types of files are placed. Some common system-wide (shared) directories are:

- **/etc**: System-wide configuration files.  
- **/usr**: Contains the majority of userland programs and data.  
  - **/usr/bin**: Executables for most user programs.  
  - **/usr/sbin**: Executables for system administration.  
  - **/usr/lib**: Shared libraries and internal binaries used by programs in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.  
  - **/usr/local**: For programs installed locally (outside of the distributionâ€™s package manager), typically in subdirectories like `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib`.  
  - **/usr/share**: Architecture-independent data such as icons, documentation, and locale files.
- **/var**: Variable data that changes during system operation.  
  - **/var/lib**: State information and variable data for system programs.
  - **/var/log**: Log files.
- **/opt**: Optional or third-party software, often self-contained packages.
- **/lib**, **/lib64**: Core system libraries (for `/bin` and `/sbin`).
- **$HOME/.config/autostart**: Applications that run at startup for a specific user. Similar to `systemctl`, but `autostart` is for user-specific applications, whereas systemctl manages system-wide services.

When you install packages using a package manager like `apt`, the files typically go into these shared directories depending on their type:

- Executables usually end up in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/sbin`.
- Libraries go into `/usr/lib`.
- Configuration files go into `/etc`.
- Documentation and data files often end up in `/usr/share`.

These directories are accessible system-wide, so all users on the system can use the installed programs without additional per-user setup.

## Examples

```bash
# Copy a local file to a remote host:
scp /path/to/local/file.txt user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/

# Copy a file from a remote host to the local machine:
scp user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file.txt /path/to/local/directory/

# Synchronize a local directory to a remote host:
# `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, times, symbolic links, etc.).
# `-v`: Verbose output.
# `-z`: Compress data during transfer.
rsync -avz /path/to/local/directory/ user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/

# Synchronize a remote directory to the local machine:
rsync -avz user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/ /path/to/local/directory/

# Mounts a USB drive at /mnt/usb so you can access its files.
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
# To unmount the filesystem mounted with:
umount /dev/sdb1
# or
umount /mnt/usb
# If the device is busy and won't unmount, try:
umount -l /mnt/usb  # Lazy unmount

# Find the process ID(s) of a running program:
# pgrep -ifa porcesss_name: -i: ingore case, -f only process id, -a: full command, similar to ps aux | grep process name
pgrep process_name

# Find processes by user:
pgrep -u username

# Find differences
diff --color -U 0 file1 file2

# Display the absolute path
readlink -f $HOME

# To create a symbolic link named `my_link` that points to a file `myfile.txt`
ln -s myfile.txt my_link

# To unzip a file to a specific location
unzip filename.zip -d /path/to/destination

# Save both standard output and error to a file. The output is also displayed on the screen.
# tee: Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.
# 2>&1: redirects stderr (2) to stdout (1).
your_command > output.txt 2>&1
your_command 2>&1 | tee output.txt

# Convert png to pdf by ImageMagick
sudo apt install imagemagick
# ImageMagick has a security policy that restricts writing PDFs. You can fix this by modifying the ImageMagick policy file and then convert your file.
# Open the policy file for editing:
sudo nano /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
# Find and modify the PDF policy:
# change `<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />` to `<policy domain="coder" rights="read | write" pattern="PDF" />` 
# Convert the png to pdf 
convert your_image.png -density 300 your_image.pdf
```
