# Linux

## Shared Directories

Linux distributions typically follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines where different types of files are placed. Some common system-wide (shared) directories are:

- **/etc**: System-wide configuration files.  
- **/usr**: Contains the majority of userland programs and data.  
  - **/usr/bin**: Executables for most user programs.  
  - **/usr/sbin**: Executables for system administration.  
  - **/usr/lib**: Shared libraries and internal binaries used by programs in `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.  
  - **/usr/local**: For programs installed locally (outside of the distributionâ€™s package manager), typically in subdirectories like `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/lib`.  
  - **/usr/share**: Architecture-independent data such as icons, documentation, and locale files.
- **/var**: Variable data that changes during system operation.  
  - **/var/lib**: State information and variable data for system programs.
  - **/var/log**: Log files.
- **/opt**: Optional or third-party software, often self-contained packages.
- **/lib**, **/lib64**: Core system libraries (for `/bin` and `/sbin`).

When you install packages using a package manager like `apt`, the files typically go into these shared directories depending on their type:

- Executables usually end up in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/sbin`.
- Libraries go into `/usr/lib`.
- Configuration files go into `/etc`.
- Documentation and data files often end up in `/usr/share`.

These directories are accessible system-wide, so all users on the system can use the installed programs without additional per-user setup.

## Examples

```bash
# Copy a local file to a remote host:
scp /path/to/local/file.txt user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/

scp user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file.txt /path/to/local/directory/

# Synchronize a local directory to a remote host:
# `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, times, symbolic links, etc.).
# `-v`: Verbose output.
# `-z`: Compress data during transfer.
rsync -avz /path/to/local/directory/ user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/

# Synchronize a remote directory to the local machine:
rsync -avz user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory/ /path/to/local/directory/
