# Object Detection Manual: A Quick Overview

## Introduction

Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, involving the classification and localization of objects within an image or video. This manual provides a quick overview of various methods to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of object detection. We'll explore different categories of object detection, including Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), CenterNet, and DETR (DEtection Transformer). Finally, we'll delve into open-set object detection and object detection with limited data.

## Categories of Object Detection Methods

Object detection methods can be categorized based on key attributes influencing their design and performance. Here are prominent categories:

- **Two-Stage vs. One-Stage Methods:**
  - Two-stage methods, like Faster R-CNN, involve region proposal and subsequent classification, offering high accuracy but may be slower.
  - One-stage methods, such as YOLO, perform object detection in a single step, providing faster inference for real-time applications.

- **Anchor-Based vs. Anchor-Free Methods:**
  - Anchor-based methods, like Faster R-CNN, use predefined anchor boxes, while anchor-free methods, such as CenterNet, eliminate the need for predefined anchors.

- **Region-Based vs. Query-Based Methods:**
  - Region-based methods divide an image into regions (e.g., Faster R-CNN), while query-based methods like DETR use transformer architectures for set prediction.

- **Plain vs. Hierarchical Methods:**
  - Plain methods maintain a single-scale feature map, e.g., [ViTDet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16527), while hierarchical methods contain multi-scale features.

## Transformer-Based Methods: DETR

**DETR (DEtection Transformer):**

- **Overview:** A transformer-based object detection model formulating object detection as a set prediction problem, simultaneously predicting object classes and bounding box coordinates.

## Open-Set Object Detection | Open Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD)

- **Overview:** Open-set object detection, or open vocabulary object detection, aims to detect objects of novel categories beyond the training vocabulary. Traditional models are limited to a fixed set, but open-set detection scales up the vocabulary size.

## Object Detection with Limited Data

To address the challenge of limited labeled data, leveraging pre-training in self-supervised learning is an effective strategy. Two prominent methods are contrastive learning and reconstruction-based methods. In contrastive learning, data augmentation is applied, and the model learns by bringing the representation of augmented parts together while pushing non-augmented parts further apart. Another method involves removing part of the data, and the model attempts to reconstruct the missing portion, as seen in Masked Autoencoders ([MAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377)).

Alternatively, foundation models—large models trained on extensive datasets—can serve as a pre-training step. These pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks using a smaller dataset or used to distill knowledge into a smaller model, minimizing size while preserving performance.

Another common approach involves training with different modalities, particularly text and image data, in a self-supervised manner. Following the success of models like [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), various methods, such as [Grounding DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499) and [OWL-VIT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06230v2), have adopted this approach for training.
