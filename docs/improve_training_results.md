# Improving Deep Learning Training Results

Deep learning training outcomes can significantly improve by focusing on three main components: data, model, and training. This framework can be expanded to "data, model, loss, optimizer," as detailed in Andrej Karpathy's insightful [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989). He suggests dividing the model into model and loss, with training encapsulated by the optimizer. Here are strategies to enhance each component:

## Data
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques to combat overfitting.
- **Expand Dataset**: Increasing the dataset size can lead to more robust training outcomes.

## Model
- **Dropout**: Integrate dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilize ReLU/GLUE for non-linear transformations.
- **Loss Functions**: Proper selection of loss functions is crucial.


## Training (Optimizer/Scheduler)
- **Epochs**: Increasing the number of iterations or epochs, especially when using dropout, is often necessary for optimal performance.
- **Learning Rate**: Adjusting the learning rate is a primary method for enhancing performance.
- **Optimizer Choice**: Switching optimizers, e.g., from Adam to AdamW, can improve results due to AdamW's weight decay feature, which acts as a regularizer.
- **Scheduling**: Implementing schedulers, with or without options for warm-up phases, can fine-tune the learning rate adjustment process over time. Example schedulers include `StepLR`, `CosineAnnealingLR`, and `ExponentialLR`, with warm-up variations like `CosLR` and `LinearLR`. 

**Note:** Weight decay, Dropout and Label Smoothing are the basic regularizers. 

**Note:** The strategies outlined above are often detailed in academic papers.
